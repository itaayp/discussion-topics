**This is my first application using Phoenix Framework. And this application is part of "The Complete Elixir and Phoenix Bootcamp and Tutorial" course, avaliable at https://udemy.com/course/the-complete-elixir-and-phoenix-bootcamp-and-tutorial/**

**ATENTION: This project isn't finished. Below you can see the TODO list**
## TODO
    1. Complete the sign in feature
    2. Create the Delete Topic feature
    3. Create the Comment Topic feature

## Discuss project
The goal of this project is to create a platform where users can create discussion topics and where other users can debate about the theme.

## Documentation
I'm using Exdoc to generate the documentation. Feel free to read it at **/discuss/doc/index.html**

## Running the application
For now, the app isn't available on the web, so if you want to run the application, follow the mentioned steps: 

In order to run this application, you need to install Elixir in your PC (you can install it from the official website: https://elixir-lang.org/install.html).

If Elixir is already installed, you can download the source code of this application to your PC, open your preferred terminal, navigate to the root folder of the application and run the following command:
`mix phoenix.server`.

Now, you can open you browser, access the application at **http://localhost:4000** and enjoy! :).
If you want to preview the OAuth authentication, access the URL: **http://localhost:4000/auth/github**.

## Elixir concepts and frameworks applied to this project
  1. Exdoc Framework - to generate the documentation
  2. Phoenix Framework
  3. OAuth Authenticator Framework
  4. Integration with Postgresql database
